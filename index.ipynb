    "# Building a Recommendation System in PySpark - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last lab, we will implement a a movie recommendation system using ALS in Spark programming environment. Spark's machine learning libraray `Mllib` comes packaged with a very efficient imeplementation of ALS algorithm that we looked at in our previous lesson. The lab will require you to put into pratice your spark programming skills for creating and manipulating RDDs. We will go through a step-by-step process into developing a movie recommendation system using a larger subset of the MovieLens dataset than the one we used in previous lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You are advised to refer to [PySpark Documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/index.html) heavily for completing this lab as it will introduce a few new methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonsrate an understanding on how recommendation systems are being used for personalization of online services/products\n",
    "* Parse and filter datasets into Spark RDDs, performing basic feature selection\n",
    "* Run a brief hyper-parameter selction activity through a scalable grid search\n",
    "* Train and evaluate the predictive performance of recommendation system\n",
    "* Generate predictions from the trained model\n"

    "We have seen how recommender/Recommendation Systems have played an  integral parts in the success of Amazon (Books, Items), Pandora/Spotify (Music), Google (News, Search), YouTube (Videos) etc.  For Amazon these systems bring more than 30% of their total revenues. For Netflix service, 75% of movies that people watch are based on some sort of recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The goal of Recommendation Systems is to find what is likely to be of interest to the user. This enables organizations to offer a high level of personalization and customer tailored services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For online video content services like Netflix and Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important. An example of recommendation system is such as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    User A watches Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.\n",
    "2.    User B performs a search query for Game of Thrones.\n",
    "3.    The system suggests Breaking Bad to user B from data collected about user A.\n",

    "Spark MLlib library for Machine Learning provides a Collaborative Filtering implementation by using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "`spark.mllib` currently supports model-based collaborative filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries. `spark.mllib` uses the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to learn these latent factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We shall work with following hyper-parameters and set their values prior to the actual training process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rank` : Number of hidden/latent factors in the model. **(use the list [2,4,6,8,10] as possible rank values)**\n",
    "* `iterations` : Number of iterations to run. **(set to 10)**\n",
    "* `lambda` :  Regularization parameter in ALS.**(set to 0.1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark offers a lot of other parameters for detailed and indepth fine tuning of the algorithm. Details on spark's ALS implementation can be viewed [HERE](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html). For now, we will use default values for all the other hyper parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Import ALS from `mllib` along with `math` module (for calculating `RMSE`) and set our learning parameters. \n",
    "- Import the ALS algorithm and set parameters as shown above. \n",

    "In this lab, we learnt how to build a model using Spark, how to perform some parameter selection using a reduced dataset, and how to update the model every time that new user preferences come in. We looked at how Spark's ALS implementation can be be used to build a scalable and efficient reommendation system. We also saw that such systems can become computationaly expensive and using them with an online system could be a problem with traditional computational platforms. Spark's disctributed computing architecture provides a great solution to deploy such recommendation systems for real worls applications (think Amazon, Spotify)."
